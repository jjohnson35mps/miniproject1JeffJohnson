Queries last 10 days of stock information for Apple, Draft King, Microsoft, Rubrik, and Tesla. It then creates graphs for each stock, plots the 10 stock prices over each day, and saves the charts to a folder called 'charts'.
 
## Description
 
The program pulls financial data from the yfinance API, processes arrays using NumPy, and plots charts with matplotlib. Each stock closing price for Apple, DraftKings, Microsoft, Rubrik, and Tesla are collected and scaled based on minimum and maximum values and plotted on a graph with X and Y axis labels and a title. The program ensures that a charts directory exists before saving the charts as .png files.
